# Data science pipeline

This is a Github repository to build my own generic Data science pipeline for use in analysis in the future. The task is to build a module to help with:
a) Exploratory Data Analysis
b) Cleaning the data and bringing it to a form usable for different algorithms. This will address common problems encountered in cleaning data such as data type mismatch, NAs/null values, outliers, and normalization.
